The full extent of the thesis is 43 pages. It contains 1 appendice and 16 references. Four figures and 2 tables are given in the thesis.

The goal of this thesis is the analysis, specification, and application of research methods of Markov SP-networks for resistance to differential cryptanalysis.

The object of research is the information processes in cryptographic protection systems.

The subject of research is the assessment algorithms for SP-networks resistance to differential cryptanalysis.

In the presented thesis the Markov SP-networks resistance to differential cryptanalysis
is assessed, taking the DSTU~7624:2014 cipher as the illustrative example.

The main ideas of the thesis were published in the Proceedings of the ХVІІІ International Scientific and Practical Conference “Information and Communication Systems Security” (Kiev, 25-26 may 2016) and XIV All-Ukrainian Scientific and Practical Conference “Theoretical and Applied Problems of Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science” (Kiev, 26-27 may 2016).

Keywords: SP-network, differential cryptanalysis, DSTU~7624:2014 cipher, differential probability.
